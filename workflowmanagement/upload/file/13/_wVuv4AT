Rosa Gini,,2015-10-06 15:09,"The catchment area of HSD data source is all country area (Italy). The representativeness of the population is statistically significant. According to the 2011 survey of the Italian National Institute of Statistics, the prevalence of diabetes in Italy (population aged 14+) was 4.9% and the prevalence in the HSD data source was 7.3 % (population aged 14+)","According to the algorithm that we regularly use (see answer B) the cases of diabetes in our data source on the 31st December 2012 are around 76,000 (population aged 14+), and the prevalence in our data source population at the same date is therefore 8.2%, (population aged 14+) .

The reason why this prevalence is higher than the estimated prevalence of diabetes provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics is that this survey is self-compiled. The people answer directly to specific questions with only their perception of illness

Giuseppe Roberto,,2015-10-06 09:50,"The catchment area of ARS' data source is the Tuscany region. According to the 2008 survey of the Italian national institute if statistics, the prevalence of diabetes in Tuscany in the general population was 5.4% and the prevalence in the population aged 16+ was 6.1% (ARS' estimates on ISTAT data). In the same age band, the prevalence on 1st January 2009 was 6.3% according to the Health Search Database [Gini 2013]. ","According to the algorithm that we regularly use (see answer B) the cases of diabetes in our data source on the 1st January 2009 are around 173,000 in the general population, only 600 aged less than 16, and the prevalence in our data source population at the same date (around 3.8 million) is therefore 4.4%, and 5.1% in the ageband 16+ (around 3.3 million). The reason why this prevalence is lower than the estimated prevalence of diabetes in the catchment area of ARS' database is likely to be mainly due to the fact that ARS does not collect diagnosis from primary care, which is the setting where diabetes diagnosis most commonly takes place. The algorithm to detect cases of diabetes in the ARS' data source uses healthcare utilization (eg antidiabetic drug utilization) as a proxy of diagnosis, thus missing those patients who do not use diabetes-specific healthcare (most notably, patients who do not need antidiabetic drugs).",,"In 2008 there was a national consensus on how to identify diabetes in data sources similar to ARS' and we adopted this definition. An external validation is ongoing. 

The algorithm detects patient who have an inpatient admission for a broad set of diabetes-related diagnosis, or an exemption from copayment for diabetes, or have more than two dispensings in a timespan of 365 days of any antidiabetic drug","We published the following papers using this condition 1.

The results are published in the Institute's website, and ARS can access the microdata of the survey. Moreover, the Health Search Database, a database participating to the EMIF network, produces regular estimates of diabetes prevalence at regional level. In a recent paper a comparison between estimates of diabetes prevalence according to different data sources in various areas of Italy was performed.
